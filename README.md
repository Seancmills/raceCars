# raceCars
In this domain there are 3 cars ready to race once the user clicks "ok" on the alert.  Once that is done the code then loops through and once a car hits a certain point in the race a prompt is shown saying that the car is ahead.  When a car hits the last point in the race another prompt is then shown saying the specific car has won.
